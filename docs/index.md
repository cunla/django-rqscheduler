A database backed job scheduler for Django RQ.
This allows remembering scheduled jobs, their parameters, etc.

!!! Info

    Starting v2023.5.0, django-rq-scheduler does not require django-rq to run. 
    Most features from django-rq are now implemented on this package.

    It is recommended you use the import/export management commands to
    save your database.

## Terminology

### Queue

A queue of messages between processes (main django-app process and worker usually).
This is implemented in `rq` package.

* A queue contains multiple registries for scheduled jobs, finished jobs, failed jobs, etc.

### Worker

A process listening to one or more queues **for jobs to be executed**, and executing jobs queued to be
executed.

### Scheduler

A process listening to one or more queues for **jobs to be scheduled for execution**, and schedule them
to be executed by a worker.

This is a sub-process of worker.

### Queued Job Execution

Once a worker listening to the queue becomes available,
the job will be executed

### Scheduled Job Execution

A scheduler checking the queue periodically will check
whether the time the job should be executed has come, and if so, it will queue it.

* A job is considered scheduled if it is queued to be executed, or scheduled to be executed.
* If there is no scheduler, the job will not be queued to run.

### Scheduled Job

django models storing information about jobs. So it is possible to schedule using
django-admin and track their status.

There are 3 types of scheduled job.

* `Scheduled Job` - Run a job once, on a specific time (can be immediate).
* `Repeatable Job` - Run a job multiple times (limited number of times or infinite times) based on an interval
* `Cron Job` - Run a job multiple times (limited number of times or infinite times) based on a cron string

Scheduled jobs are scheduled when the django application starts, and after a scheduled job is executed.

    autonumber
    box Worker
        participant scheduler as Scheduler Process
    end
    box Redis queue
        participant queue as Queue
        participant schedule as Queue scheduled jobs
    end    
    loop Scheduler process - loop forever
        scheduler ->> schedule: check whether there are jobs that should be scheduled for execution
        critical there are jobs that are scheduled to be executed
            scheduler ->> schedule: remove jobs to be scheduled
            scheduler ->> queue: enqueue jobs to be executed
        end
        scheduler ->> scheduler: sleep interval (See SCHEDULER_INTERVAL)
    end
```

## Worker sequence diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    box Worker
        participant worker as Worker Process
    end
    box Redis queue
        participant queue as Queue
        participant finished as Queue finished jobs
        participant failed as Queue failed jobs
    end    
    loop Worker process - loop forever
        worker ->>+ queue: get the first job to be executed
        queue -->>- worker: A job to be executed or nothing 
        critical There is a job to be executed
            worker ->> queue: Remove job from queue
            worker ->> worker: Execute job
            critical Job ended successfully
                worker ->> finished: Write job result
            option Job ended unsuccessfully
                worker ->> failed: Write job result
            end
        option No job to be executed
            worker ->> worker: sleep 
        end       
    end
```

## Acknowledgements

Based on original [django-rq-scheduler](https://github.com/isl-x/django-rq-scheduler) - Now supports Django 4.0.

A lot of django-admin views and their tests were adopted from [django-rq](https://github.com/rq/django-rq).
